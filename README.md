# School Shootings Dataset

## Data Profile

The data, retrieved from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/school-shootings), includes school shooting incidents in the United States since the Columbine High massacre in 1999. This dataset only accounts for school shootings that occured immediately before, after, or during class hours. It also excludes accidental firearm incidents and any shootings that occured at universities or colleges. It is not exhaustive and other shootings that would otherwise qualify to be included may not be. 

## Analysis Aims 

The analysis aims to answer the following questions: 

- Have the rate of school shootings increased in the last two decades? 
  
- What factors contribute to the prevalance of school shootings? 
 
- What is the profile of the average school shooter?

## Analysis Summary  

After analyzing the dataset, though accounting for missing values, it appears the rate of school shootings has increased significantly in the last two decades. While it seems the rate of casualties for shootings has stayed consistent over the years, there are far more outliers with higher casualty counts, especially in the last six years. As expected, when comparing those injured to killed in school shootings, there are more injured than killed. This is fairly consistent over the last two decades. The rate of those killed appears to be lower in more recent years compared to previous years. 

The racial profiles of enrolled students at the time of these school shootings seems to not factor in significantly. Though week day shows an interesting trend with the number of school shootings decreasing almost correlationally as the week progresses from Monday to Friday. Additionally, it appears the prescence of resource officers at the school at the time of the shooting plays a significant role. There are fewer school shootings when a resource officer is present compared to when they are not present. As expected, the average age of a school shooter tends to hover around the higher teens age. Interestingly, the state with the highest percentage of school shootings is California at just over 10%, which is followed by a steady drop in the next highest states.
